#Google Clone

This is a simple beginner project for The Odin Project which involves creating a clone of the Google homepage. Key points to be learned here are foundational skills in HTML/CSS, navigating and using VS Code, and Git. 

This, of course, is not a perfect clone. The objectives of building familiarity with the skills listed above were met.
